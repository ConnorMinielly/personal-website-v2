        Animation Fundamentals For Programmers Like Me And You
      </h2>
      <p style="padding-bottom: 2rem">
        I did this talk a couple years back as an opportunity to chat about
        something I have a lot of passion for: animation! While not every aspect
        of traditional animation translates to the web, I think understanding
        the concepts that animators have used for the past 70 years to create
        charming and appealing motion art is really critical. So, that said,
        enjoy the talk! And sorry for the recording quality, we were trying a
        new venue that night and the AV setup was not as good as we were used
        to.
